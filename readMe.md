Project assignment made with node.js using Express.js as a framework.
The project is a Restful API for Star Wars frontEnd Application.

## The API

There is a Postman collection with examples of requests on the folder `./postman-collections`

## Solution Design

This projects contain two patterns: Routes and Repositories.

Routes is where I placed the endpoints and I parse the HTTP into validate data for the application.

Repositories is where I retrive the data.
